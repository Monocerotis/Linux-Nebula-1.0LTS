Linux Nebula 1.0 LTS. README

K well this is a project to help me and my friends learn to program. We want to create a GUI that we can use to replace the current Android GUI.

Just so you know we do not intend for this to be widely used (unless if every-one wants to), and if it gets good enough for every one to use :).



We will be using the free version of "unreal engine", ywah i know that it is a game engine but my friend and I want to try make a few games first. So that we can learn how to use "Unreal Engine".


We have also got a games programing class at school so then we can make this durring those lessons as well as our IT lessons.
